<h1><center><u><font size=+5>How To Prevent Flooding From A Hurricane</font></u></center></h1>

<h1><center><u>Problem</u></center></h1>

<p><font size="+2">Hurricanes have always been causing major floods and destroying people’s homes in the past.  Many times people aren’t prepared but even if they are, floods have always managed to enter houses and flood people’s homes.  How can we prevent the destruction of homes and protect people’s property in an easy and cost-effective way?</font></p>

<h1><center><u>Existing Solutions</center></u></h1>

<p><font size="+2">Many solutions have been made concerning this problem.  In order to prevent water from entering people’s homes, people put sandbags by all their doorways.  They also put tarp or duct tape around the doorway to seal it.  There is even a floodgate, which is a large, water-tight door, made for homes but they are very expensive.

<h1><center><u>Our Solution</u></center></h1>

<p><font size="+2">The existing solutions are great.  However, we want less costly and more effective ways of preventing floods.  When we were researching, we found out that to prevent water from entering a tunnel, they use a floodgate- a big,custom-made, marine door, with an inflatable gasket surrounding it.  Using the logic behind it, we thought of using an inflatable gasket to surround  the door of a regular home.  If it works for the tunnels, it can work for regular buildings.</font></p>
